# Potato_Disease_Prediction
In this project, i trained model on kaggle and also took potatoes dataset from kaggle, then i load my model in VS code to implement Flask and streamlit. When you upload potato leaf image, then you will get the result if potato is healthy or diseased(early_blight, late_blight)
